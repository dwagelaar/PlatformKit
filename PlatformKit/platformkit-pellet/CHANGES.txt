Change Log

Pellet 1.3 (Apr 17, 2005)
-------------------------

* ENHANCED: SPARQL query engine PelletQueryExecution tu answer non-SELECT queries

* ADDED: Processing class expressions in SPARQL queries

* ADDED: Treating bnodes in SPARQL queries as non-distinguished variables

* ADDED: Query optimization features (simplification and reordering). Reordering feature is 
         disabled by default and needs to be enabled in the configuration file.

* ENHANCED: Datatype reasoning support for user-defined datatypes

* ADDED: Support for InverseFunctional datatype properties (a.k.a. keys). (experimental)

* ADDED: Support for DL-safe rules (experimental)

* ENHANCED: Pellet command line options

* ENHANCED: More configuration parameters in pellet.properties


Pellet 1.3-beta2 (Nov 1, 2005)
------------------------------
* MODIFIED: Jena jar files to version 2.3

* ADDED: SPARQL query engine named PelletQueryExecution

* ADDED: A new option PelletOptions.USE_UNIQUE_NAME_ASSUMPTION

* ADDED: A new option PelletOptions.TREAT_ALL_VARS_DISTINGUISHED that is true
         by default so that all variables in a query are treated as distiguished 
         even though they do not appear in the SELECT clause. Earlier, this option
         was considered to be false by default.
         
* ADDED: Classification progress bar

* ENHANCED: KRSS support to load these files independent of DL-becnhmark tests

* ENHANCED: Preprocessing step for much faster TBox and RBox processing

* ENHANCED: Internal query engines for answering queries

* ENHANCED: Nominal absorption for hasValue restrictions

* ENHANCED: Told subsumer computation for union class descriptions

* ENHANCED: PelletInfGraph.graphBaseContains function to handle Node.ANY parameters
            gracefully

* FIXED: Various bugs related to datatypes

* ENHANCED: Optimize loading from Jena models

* ADDED: PelletInfGraph generates ABox answers when predicate is not 
         given

* ADDED: PelletInfGraph generates answers for disjointWith, complementOf
         and sameAs queries

* FIXED: Answering queries about anon classes in PelletinfGraph

* ADDED: Reasoning with user-defined numeric datatypes

* ADDED: OWLLoader class to use Jena graph interface to load ontologies
         instead of OWLParser that uses Jena model interface

Pellet 1.2 (Jun 22, 2005)
---------------------------

* MODIFIED: Jena jar files to version 2.2

* ENHANCED: PelletInfGraph reloads only the submodel that was changed
            when there are only additions (no deletions)

* ENHANCED: Speed up in PelletInfGraph when subject and object are not 
            variables.
            
* ENHANCED: findWithContinuation() function in PelletInfGraph to return 
            answers without classifying the ontology whenever possible
            
* ADDED: Alternative implementation of contains() function in 
         PelletInfGraph that works without classifying the ontology

* ENHANCED: Classification code uses an adjacency list instead of adjacancy
            matrix (using linear space instead of quadratic)

* ENHANCED: Internal query engines 

* FIXED: Duplicate answers generated by PelletQueryEngine

* MODIFIED: Use Jena ResultBindingImpl instead of PelletResultBinding

* ADDED: PelletReasonerFactory to create PelletReasoner

* ADDED: Function to check datatype subsumption in OWLReasoner class

* ENHANCED: RDQL support in command line Pellet

            no language identifier

* FIXED: Nominal problem in DL Expressivity 

* FIXED: Problems due to inverse properties in computeSubRoles

* ENHANCED: TBox absorption performance

* ADDED: More query functions to OWL-API reasoner implementation
